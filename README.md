# Project presentation and functions used

## Presentation : 
The aim of this project is to explore if the heterogeneity of schizophrenia can be tackled by dividing the patients into subgroups using unsupervised learning. A clinical data set where 227 schizophrenia patients performed a battery of perceptual and cognitive tasks has been provided. The purpose is to build clusters in order to construct different classifications and use them to describe differences between groups of patients. To validate the subgroups,  polygenic risk scores and the symptoms subscales are provided in the data set.

## Data set :
The data set is not available as it contains highly confidential information. The computed results and plots are nonetheless present in the provided Jupyter notebook.

## Needed packages in order to run the code:

To run the code, one needs to download the latest version of Python.
Moreover, the following external libraries are used:
- NumPy
- Sklearn
- SciPy

## Clustering methods: 
Three clustering methods were used: K-Means with the L1 norm, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and DBSCAN.
